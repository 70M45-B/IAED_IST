# IAED_IST
## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures projects
The goal of the project was to build a public transportation career management system.
For that, the system allows the definition of stations (stops) and routes, as well as their consultation. 
The second project is an extension of the first one, using dynamic memory instead of contiguous memory.
